## Key Features:

* **Automated Food Service:** The bot precisely follows a black line on the floor, stopping at designated positions to serve food to residents, ensuring timely and convenient meal distribution.
* **Dynamic Obstacle Detection & Safety:** Equipped with **ultrasonic sensors**, the Serve-bot can detect and stop for obstacles in its path, including people or objects, prioritizing safety and preventing collisions. It automatically resumes its route once the path is clear.
* **Resident Needs Recording:** A unique feature of the Serve-bot is its ability to record specific needs or requests from residents using an integrated voice playback module.
* **Centralized Need Playback:** At the culmination of its service rounds, all recorded resident needs are played back, allowing caregivers to efficiently address individual requirements and provide personalized attention.
